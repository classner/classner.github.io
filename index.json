Two key components of such systems are: (1) detailed pose and shape estimation and (2) generation of images. Ideally, they should use 2D images as input signal so that they can be applied easily and on arbitrary digital images. Due to the high complexity of human appearance and the depth ambiguities in 2D space, data driven models are the tool at hand to design such methods. In this work, we consider two aspects of such systems: in the first part, we propose general optimization and implementation techniques for machine learning models and make them available in the form of software packages. In the second part, we present in multiple steps, how the detailed analysis and generation of human appearance based on digital 2D images can be realized. We work with two machine learning methods: Decision Forests and Artificial Neural Networks. The contribution of this thesis to the theory of Decision Forests consists of the introduction of a generalized entropy function that is efficient to evaluate and tunable to specific tasks and allows us to establish relations to frequently used heuristics. For both, Decision Forests and Neural Networks, we present methods for implementation and a software package. Existing methods for 3D body estimation from images usually estimate the 14 most important, pose defining points in 2D and convert them to a 3D `skeleton'. In this work we show that a carefully crafted energy function is sufficient to recover a full 3D body shape automatically from the keypoints. In this way, we devise the first fully automatic method estimating 3D body pose and shape from a 2D image. While this method successfully recovers a coarse 3D pose and shape, it is still a challenge to recover details such as body part rotations. However, for more detailed models, it would be necessary to annotate data with a very rich set of cues. This approach does not scale to large datasets, since the effort per image as well as the required quality could not be reached due to how hard it is to estimate the position of keypoints on the body surface. To solve this problem, we develop a method that can alternate between optimizing the 2D and 3D models, improving them iteratively. The labeling effort for humans remains low. At the same time, we create 2D models reasoning about factors more items than existing methods and we extend the 3D pose and body shape estimation to rotation and body extent. To generate images of people, existing methods usually work with 3D models that are hard to adjust and to use. In contrast, we develop a method that builds on the possibilities for automatic 3D body estimation: we use it to create a dataset of 3D bodies together with 2D clothes and cloth segments. With this information, we develop a data driven model directly producing 2D images of people. Only the broad interplay of 2D and 3D body and appearance models in different forms makes it possible to achieve a high level of detail for analysis and generation of human appearance. The developed techniques can in principle also be used for the analysis and generation of images of other creatures and objects.","tags":[],"title":"Combining Data-Driven 2D and 3D Human Appearance Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yinghao Huang","Federica Bogo","Christoph Lassner","Angjoo Kanazawa","Peter V.

Second, we use a CNN method to segment the person in each image and fit the 3D body model to the contours, further improving accuracy. Third we utilize a generic and robust DCT temporal prior to handle the left and right side swapping issue sometimes introduced by the 2D pose estimator.

We estimate a full 3D mesh and show that 2D joints alone carry a surprising amount of information about body shape. The problem is challenging because of the complexity of the human body, articulation, occlusion, clothing, lighting, and the inherent ambiguity in inferring 3D from 2D. To solve this, we first use a recently published CNN-based method, DeepCut, to predict (bottom-up) the 2D body joint locations. We then fit (top-down) a recently published statistical body shape model, called SMPL, to the 2D joints. We do so by minimizing an objective function that penalizes the error between the projected 3D model joints and detected 2D joints. Because SMPL captures correlations in human shape across the population, we are able to robustly fit it to very little data. We further leverage the 3D model to prevent solutions that cause interpenetration. We evaluate our method, SMPLify, on the Leeds Sports, HumanEva, and Human3.6M datasets, showing superior pose accuracy with respect to the state of the art.","tags":[],"title":"Keep it SMPL: Automatic Estimation of 3D Human Pose and Shape from a Single Image","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christoph Lassner","Rainer Lienhart"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1444430599,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1444430599,"objectID":"08f71da2d602008a2bed5b4725d57a8c","permalink":"https://christophlassner.de/publication/fertilized/","publishdate":"2020-03-09T15:43:19-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/fertilized/","section":"publication","summary":"Since the introduction of Random Forests in the 80's they have been a frequently used statistical tool for a variety of machine learning tasks. Many different training algorithms and model adaptions demonstrate the versatility of the forests. This variety resulted in a fragmentation of research and code, since each adaption requires its own algorithms and representations. In 2011, Criminisi and Shotton developed a unifying Decision Forest model for many tasks. By identifying the reusable parts and specifying clear interfaces, we extend this approach to an object oriented representation and implementation. This has the great advantage that research on specific parts of the Decision Forest model can be done `locally' by reusing well-tested and high-performance components. Our fertilized forests library is open source and easy to extend. It provides components allowing for parallelization up to node optimization level to exploit modern many core architectures. Additionally, the library provides consistent and easy-to-maintain interfaces to C++, Python and Matlab and offers cross-platform and cross-interface persistence.","tags":[],"title":"The fertilized forests Decision Forest Library","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexander Schiendorfer","Christoph Lassner","Gerrit Anders","Wolfgang Reif","Rainer Lienhart"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1441843184,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1441843184,"objectID":"6b161138a6e5045eda592f5d022e3406","permalink":"https://christophlassner.de/publication/active-sampling/","publishdate":"2020-03-09T16:59:44-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/active-sampling/","section":"publication","summary":"Many large-scale systems benefit from an organizational structure to provide for problem decomposition. A pivotal problem solving setting is given by hierarchical control systems familiar from hierarchical task networks. If these structures can be modified autonomously by, e.g., coalition formation and reconfiguration, adequate decisions on higher levels require a faithful abstracted model of a collective of agents. An illustrative example is found in calculating schedules for a set of power plants organized in a hierarchy of Autonomous Virtual Power Plants. Functional dependencies over the combinatorial domain, such as the joint costs or rates of change of power production, are approximated by repeatedly sampling input-output pairs and substituting the actual functions by piecewise linear functions. However, if the sampled data points are weakly informative, the resulting abstracted high-level optimization introduces severe errors. Furthermore, obtaining additional point labels amounts to solving computationally hard optimization problems. Building on prior work, we propose to apply techniques from active learning to maximize the information gained by each additional point. Our results show that significantly better allocations in terms of cost-efficiency (up to 33.7 % reduction in costs in our case study) can be found with fewer but carefully selected sampling points using Decision Forests.","tags":[],"title":"Active Learning for Efficient Sampling of Control Models of Collectives","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1425946704,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1425946704,"objectID":"14041cffa7c58578f190b9460dec6d16","permalink":"https://christophlassner.de/publication/active-collectives/","publishdate":"2020-03-09T17:18:24-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/active-collectives/","section":"publication","summary":"Organizational structures such as hierarchies provide an effective means to deal with the increasing complexity found in large-scale energy systems.

The Shannon entropy and other generalized entropies such as the Renyi and Tsallis entropy are designed to fulfill the Khinchin-Shannon axioms.

In this paper, we show that when omitting two of the four axioms, every norm induces an entropy function. The remaining two axioms are sufficient to describe the requirements for an entropy function in the decision forest context. Furthermore, we introduce and analyze the p-norm-induced entropy, show relations to existing entropies and the relation to various heuristics that are commonly used for decision forest training. In experiments with classification, regression and the recently introduced Hough forests, we show how the discrete and differential form of the new entropy can be used for forest induction and how the functions can simply be fine-tuned.

We show how the error function of an ANN can be modified such that it works solely with objective distances instead of objective values. We derive the adjusted rules for backpropagation through networks with arbitrary depths and include practical considera- tions that must be taken into account to apply difference based learning successfully. On all three benchmark datasets we use, linear SVMs trained on automatically learned ANN features outperform RBF kernel SVMs trained on the raw data. This can be achieved in a feature space with up to only a tenth of dimensions of the number of original data dimensions. We conclude our work with two experiments on distance based ANN training in two further fields: data visualization and outlier detection.","tags":[],"title":"Methods and Applications for Distance Based ANN Training","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christoph Lassner"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1336609425,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1336609425,"objectID":"efd6dafe09ee9186e7dc5d4d8689beee","permalink":"https://christophlassner.de/publication/diploma-thesis/","publishdate":"2020-03-09T17:23:45-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/diploma-thesis/","section":"publication","summary":"The field of Human Pose Estimation is developing fast and lately leaped forward with the release of the Kinect system. That system reaches a very good perfor- mance for pose estimation using 3D scene information, however pose estimation from 2D color images is not solved reliably yet. There is a vast amount of pub- lications trying to reach this aim, but no compilation of important methods and solution strategies. The aim of this thesis is to fill this gap: it gives an introductory overview over important techniques by analyzing four current (2012) publications in detail. They are chosen such, that during their analysis many frequently used techniques for Human Pose Estimation can be explained. The thesis includes two introductory chapters with a definition of Human Pose Estimation and exploration of the main difficulties, as well as a detailed explanation of frequently used methods. A final chapter presents some ideas on how parts of the analyzed approaches can be recombined and shows some open questions that can be tackled in future work. The thesis is therefore a good entry point to the field of Human Pose Estimation and enables the reader to get an impression of the current state-of-the-art.","tags":[],"title":"An Analysis of Successful Approaches to Human Pose Estimation","type":"publication"}]
